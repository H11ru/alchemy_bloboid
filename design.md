lets make a alchemy game in pygame

theres gonna be a huyge windwo with 4 parts:


- top left: mine. it wil lbe a gray window with a grid of either gray square (rock), gray square with white horixontal stripes (quartzium), or some other minerals. add a fog of war mechanic to the mine. It regenerates when you press the regen button in the top left.
- top right: inventory. it has all materials textures and a number below them saying how many you have. ones with 0 are not displayed.
- bottom left: crafting. it has a grid where you can combine items to make more. there are two slots and you can drag 1 mineral from the inventory into either slot. make sure thast if you dont finish dragging into a slot the item doesnt dissapear number go back up, and the number decrements immidiatly when you start dragging, and if you drag into a filled slot it swaps with the thing in it and retursn that to inve. it has a yellow combine butotin that tries to combine them. if it exists, it gives you that and slots become empty. If it doesnt exist, it spawns 15 texts of random colors from red to yellow and orange that sya "BOOM!" that fly everywhere and dissapear, and both items dissapear.
- bottom right: garden. plants grow here. clicking them makes them dissapear and gives you resources.
